    <p>
      Drag kings are mostly female performance artists who dress in masculine
      drag and personify male gender stereotypes as part of an individual or
      group routine. A typical drag show may incorporate dancing, acting,
      stand-up comedy, and singing, either live or lip-synching to pre-recorded
      tracks. Drag kings often perform as exaggeratedly macho male characters,
      portray marginalized masculinities such as construction workers, rappers,
      or they will impersonate male celebrities like Elvis Presley, Justin Timberlake, and Tim McGraw.
      <br />
      In the late 1800s and early 1900s, several drag kings became British music
      hall stars, and British pantomime has preserved the tradition of women
      performing in male roles. Starting in the mid-1990s, drag kings started to
      gain some of the fame and attention that drag queens have known.
